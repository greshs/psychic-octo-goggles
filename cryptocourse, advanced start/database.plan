Step 1: Plan the Database Structure

Identify the entities: In this case, the main entity is likely to be the "User."
Determine the attributes: Based on the given data, the attributes for the User entity would include mail, login name, phone number, real name, city, IP address, device, active courses, and finished courses.
Step 2: Choose a Database Management System (DBMS)

Select a suitable DBMS based on your requirements. Popular options include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
Install and set up the chosen DBMS on your server or local machine.
Step 3: Create the Database

Using the chosen DBMS, create a new database. Choose an appropriate name for your database, such as "CryptoCourseDB."
Step 4: Design the Database Tables

Determine the tables needed to store the data. In this case, you will need a table to store user information.
Create a table named "Users" (or a suitable name) with columns corresponding to the attributes: mail, login name, phone number, real name, city, IP address, device, active courses, and finished courses.
Step 5: Define the Table Structure

Define the data types and constraints for each column. For example:
mail: VARCHAR(255) (assuming maximum length of 255 characters)
login name: VARCHAR(50)
phone number: VARCHAR(20)
real name: VARCHAR(100)
city: VARCHAR(100)
IP address: VARCHAR(20)
device: VARCHAR(100)
active courses: TEXT (or appropriate data type depending on the complexity of the course structure)
finished courses: TEXT (or appropriate data type)
Step 6: Set Primary Key and Constraints

Identify a primary key for the Users table. Typically, you can use an auto-incremented integer column as the primary key, such as "user_id."
Step 7: Create the Database Schema

Using the chosen DBMS, write the SQL code to create the Users table with the specified columns, data types, constraints, and primary key.
